	<p>This is the second installment of the dev log. Let's see if we can keep this streak going!</p>
<h2 id="waka" tabindex="-1">Waka <a class="header-anchor" href="#waka">#</a></h2>
<p>I've made some improvements to health checks - they now check if the realtime data is working in Auckland. It's still at <a href="https://assets-us-west-2.waka.app/status/index.html">https://assets-us-west-2.waka.app/status/index.html</a>, but will eventually be rolled into the app.</p>
<p><img src="/images/waka-2018-healthchecks.jpg" alt="SMS Notifications for Health Checks"></p>
<p>SMS notifications now trigger when the health checks fail (super simple with Amazon SNS), so I'll know a lot sooner if Waka is down.</p>
<p>I'm also trying to answer the question &quot;What routes in Auckland travel the most km per week?&quot;. I should have the answer to that tomorrow, and I'll do a little bit of a writeup.</p>
<p>Other than that, there's been nothing done in actual Waka. Matt hasn't done anything on <code>waka-importer</code> either.</p>
<h2 id="nitro-3" tabindex="-1">Nitro 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#nitro-3">#</a></h2>
<p>I've spent most of my time coding Nitro this month.</p>
<p><img src="/images/nitro-2018-sync-indicator.png" alt="Nitro Sync Indicator"></p>
<p>The overlay position is now fixed - no matter where it's opened from. However, it's a bit laggy in some browsers (Edge), and can be laggy on Retina screens. I'll fix it eventually, but not for the initial release. There's also a new sync indicator - when a task is syncing, an icon shows up.</p>
<p>The biggest change is from my own custom username/password auth to <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a>. It provides a decent user experience, and I don't have to worry about other things such as sign up, 2FA, and OAuth. Unfortunately it seems to log you out a lot, but it's not a huge deal as it's only a single click to log back in.</p>
<p>I also fixed a couple of other bugs and papercuts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the sign out button back</li>
<li>Added proper error messages on the login page</li>
<li>Upgraded all dependencies</li>
<li>Fixed the list ordering without all list</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition when notes were being saved</li>
</ul>
<p>Next month, I want to continue to focus on fixing bugs and improve the performance on slower machines and phones. I also want the sync to be a bit better - stopping your browser from closing if sync is in progress, and triggering a sync if you haven't been using Nitro for some time. Oh, and I still need to add the settings menu.</p>

<p>That's it for November! If you have any questions, flick them through to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/consindo">Twitter</a>, and I'll try answer them in the next post.</p>
