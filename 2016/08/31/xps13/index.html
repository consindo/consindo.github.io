        <p>I recently bought a Dell XPS 13, to replace my Surface Pro 3. These devices roughly cost the same, but I managed to snag a last generation XPS with the improved screen for the same price as a current generation with the regular HD display. I miss out on USB-C and improved graphics, but that’s not a huge deal.</p>
<p>While both of these devices are a generation behind, they’re very similar to the current model, so this comparison is still valid.</p>
<p><img src="/images/xps13.jpg" alt="My XPS 13"></p>
<h2 id="What-the-XPS-does-better"><a href="#What-the-XPS-does-better" class="headerlink" title="What the XPS does better"></a>What the XPS does better</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>Screen</strong> This is the best part of the XPS 13. The 3200x1800 resolution is great, and apps like Photoshop look great at 200% scaling. There’s more pixels on this thing than the 15” MacBook Pro! Oh, and the tiny bezels are beautiful.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Battery</strong> Even with the crazy screen, the XPS lasts 9 hours. The Surface with a fresh battery only lasts 5 hours. The power management also seems a lot better - the Surface always used to randomly turn on in my bag.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Connectivity</strong> The XPS has an extra USB port, lock slot and a full sized SD card reader. The newer model even has Thunderbolt over USB-C! Oh, and if you thought Broadcom Wi-Fi was bad, the Atheros chip in the Surface will drive your head through a wall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-the-Surface-does-better"><a href="#What-the-Surface-does-better" class="headerlink" title="What the Surface does better"></a>What the Surface does better</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>Stylus</strong> The Surface has pen support, which works really well. It’s great if you want to annotate things, or draw. However, I find paper better because you can spread it around on a table and refer back a bit easier. Oh, and since printing is an enormous hassle, I just handwrite my assignments anyway. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Keyboard</strong> The Type Cover 4 is less mushy, even though it has less travel.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Audio</strong> The Surface has front facing speakers and never any software issues. On the XPS, very occasionally headphones aren’t detected or the sound quality deteriorates (a reboot fixes this).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Things-other-people-have-issues-with"><a href="#Things-other-people-have-issues-with" class="headerlink" title="Things other people have issues with"></a>Things other people have issues with</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Webcam</strong> The XPS 13 has stupid webcam placement, but I use my phone for video calling.</li>
<li><strong>Form Factor</strong> The Surface is also a tablet.</li>
<li><strong>Windows Hello</strong> Only the Surface Pro 4 has this, but it’s really cool.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 10 Pro</strong> The Surface comes with it, but I had a spare license for my XPS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-both-could-do-better"><a href="#What-both-could-do-better" class="headerlink" title="What both could do better"></a>What both could do better</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>Trackpad</strong> The trackpad on the Type Cover 4 is too small. The XPS 13 doesn’t support four finger gestures. I just wish I could switch desktops with 3 fingers. There’s also a lot of apps in Windows that don’t handle precision scrolling well *<em>cough</em>* <em>Electron</em> *<em>cough</em>*.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Windows 10</strong> Sometimes Windows Explorer messes up and I can’t use instant search. It’s very annoying, and I need to restart the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-Verdict"><a href="#The-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="The Verdict"></a>The Verdict</h2><p>I like the XPS more, if only because of the nicer screen and significantly better battery. If a tablet and stylus is important to you, get a Surface.</p>
