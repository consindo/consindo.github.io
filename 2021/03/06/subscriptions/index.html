        <p>I have quite a few subscriptions, both online and offline. I quite like a lot of these things, so I thought I would share.</p>
<h2 id="Online"><a href="#Online" class="headerlink" title="Online"></a>Online</h2><h3 id="Spotify"><a href="#Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Spotify"></a>Spotify</h3><p>I’ve had a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/nz/">Spotify</a> subscription ever since it came to NZ in 2012. I still think it’s the best all around music streaming service. I’m currently using a family plan, with five friends. Apparently we’re all live together in a one bedroom apartment. <strong>$3.75&#x2F;month.</strong></p>
<h3 id="1Password"><a href="#1Password" class="headerlink" title="1Password"></a>1Password</h3><p>I’ve also been using <a href="1password.com">1Password</a> ever since the subscription service started, and I’m still really happy with it. I love they have fantastic apps on every platform—I use the Windows, Mac, Android, and Web apps on a daily basis. Like Spotify, I share it with a large group of friends. <strong>$1 USD&#x2F;month.</strong></p>
<h3 id="Day-One"><a href="#Day-One" class="headerlink" title="Day One"></a>Day One</h3><p>Unlike 1Password, the <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> apps outside of the Apple ecosystem aren’t very good. Despite this, I still find it to be a fantastic app for keeping a journal because it’s so specialized to the task. I use it every day, and it sets me back <strong>$2.92&#x2F;month.</strong></p>
<h3 id="DigitalOcean"><a href="#DigitalOcean" class="headerlink" title="DigitalOcean"></a>DigitalOcean</h3><p>I run a <a href="https://m.do.co/c/359af8087554">DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster</a> that runs Waka and the everylotbots. I don’t run everything on it though. I still have a home server cluster running <a href="https://microk8s.io/">microk8s</a>, that runs a <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/">UniFi controller</a>, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, and a few other things. I manage to only use a single Digital Ocean instance, which ends up costing <strong>$38&#x2F;month.</strong></p>
<h3 id="AWS-Lightsail"><a href="#AWS-Lightsail" class="headerlink" title="AWS Lightsail"></a>AWS Lightsail</h3><p>These days, I only spend a couple of dollars with AWS a month. I run a tiny <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/">Lightsail</a> instance, for my Mum’s Wordpress site. <strong>$3.50 USD&#x2F;month.</strong></p>
<h3 id="Xbox-Game-Pass"><a href="#Xbox-Game-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Game Pass"></a>Xbox Game Pass</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-NZ/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> library is getting pretty large for PC these days (~100 games). Microsoft often advertise offers where they’ll give you <strong>3 months for $1</strong>. Afterwards, I cancel and go back to my purchased games until another offer comes up.</p>
<h3 id="Photoshop-amp-Lightroom"><a href="#Photoshop-amp-Lightroom" class="headerlink" title="Photoshop &amp; Lightroom"></a>Photoshop &amp; Lightroom</h3><p>There’s now a <a href="https://www.adobe.com/nz/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">free version of Lightroom</a> in AU&#x2F;NZ, but I do enough photo editing to justify paying for it. Photoshop also comes in handy sometimes. I share this with a friend, so if I’m away from my desktop PC, I have to do my editing over remote desktop. <strong>$7.50 AUD&#x2F;month.</strong></p>
<h3 id="Sharesies"><a href="#Sharesies" class="headerlink" title="Sharesies"></a>Sharesies</h3><p>I do most of my investing through <a href="https://sharesies.nz/r/CRDHC6">Sharesies</a>, which I find pretty good. It doesn’t charge transaction fees, but there is a small monthly charge based on the amount you have invested. I’ve also tried a few other platforms—Hatch, which lets you buy US shares, and Link Market Services. The fees tend to be higher, and the user experience isn’t nearly as good. I end up spending <strong>$3&#x2F;month on Sharesies fees</strong>, but try to invest a few hundred every month.</p>
<h3 id="YNAB"><a href="#YNAB" class="headerlink" title="YNAB"></a>YNAB</h3><p>I use <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a> to keep my budget under control, and I find it saves me hundreds of dollars every month. I wish it had bank feeds in NZ, but bank feeds are difficult, even in the UK &amp; EU with Open Banking. YNAB costs <strong>$7 USD&#x2F;month</strong>, but it’s worth every cent.</p>
<h2 id="Offline"><a href="#Offline" class="headerlink" title="Offline"></a>Offline</h2><h3 id="2degrees-Phone-Internet"><a href="#2degrees-Phone-Internet" class="headerlink" title="2degrees Phone + Internet"></a>2degrees Phone + Internet</h3><p>I get both through <a href="https://www.2degrees.nz/">2degrees</a>, which tends to have the best international peering. At home, I get 1Gbps and a static IP for <strong>$110&#x2F;month</strong>. I also have their <strong>$27&#x2F;month mobile plan</strong> which gives a measly 2.5GB of data.</p>
<h3 id="Auckland-Transport"><a href="#Auckland-Transport" class="headerlink" title="Auckland Transport"></a>Auckland Transport</h3><p>I’m trying to cycle to work more this year, and work from home when the weather isn’t good. As a result, I’m not spending a lot on the <a href="https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/fares-discounts/bus-train-fares/">relatively expensive train&#x2F;bus fares</a> anymore ($7.80 for a return trip to the city). Last year, I was spending around $150 a month, but often spend <strong>under $50&#x2F;month</strong> these days.</p>
<h3 id="News"><a href="#News" class="headerlink" title="News"></a>News</h3><p>I currently subscribe to <a href="https://members.thespinoff.co.nz/">the Spinoff Members</a>, and a print subscription to <a href="https://www.metromag.co.nz/">Metro</a>. I just cancelled my print subscription to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a>, because I wasn’t really reading it.</p>
<h3 id="Kokako-Coffee"><a href="#Kokako-Coffee" class="headerlink" title="Kōkako Coffee"></a>Kōkako Coffee</h3><p>Kōkako have a <a href="https://www.kokako.co.nz/collections/coffee-subscriptions">coffee subscription</a> where they send you a different bag of their coffee every month. I originally received as a gift, but it’s fabulous and I have every intention to continue it. A subscription will set you back <strong>$15.50&#x2F;month.</strong></p>
<h3 id="Cityhop-Car-Sharing"><a href="#Cityhop-Car-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Cityhop Car Sharing"></a>Cityhop Car Sharing</h3><p>I don’t own a car, but I’ve been using <a href="https://www.cityhop.co.nz/">Cityhop</a> when I need one. It costs ~$10&#x2F;hour or ~$60&#x2F;day, depending on the vehicle. There’s plenty of cars in the city centre, but I wish there was one walking distance from my house. I don’t need it particularly often, so I spend <strong>under $100&#x2F;month</strong>. It’s still way cheaper than owning a car.</p>
<h3 id="Genesis-Electricity"><a href="#Genesis-Electricity" class="headerlink" title="Genesis Electricity"></a>Genesis <strong>Electricity</strong></h3><p>I currently have this through <a href="https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/">Genesis</a>, because they offered a great sign up deal. It changes every month, but it usually ends up to be <strong>less than $80&#x2F;month</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Water"><a href="#Water" class="headerlink" title="Water"></a>Water</h3><p>In Auckland, <a href="https://www.watercare.co.nz/">water &amp; wastewater</a> transmission is not included in your rates (technically, the water is free). <strong>This is a good thing.</strong> It’s usually less than $20&#x2F;month, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/Beywake/status/1367661874926415878">pipes don’t explode in the street</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Auckland-Rates"><a href="#Auckland-Rates" class="headerlink" title="Auckland Rates"></a>Auckland <strong>Rates</strong></h3><p>This is a bit of a deal. <a href="https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/">Auckland</a> has the cheapest rates in the country and the best amenities—there’s fantastic parks, libraries, community centres, roads, rubbish collection, events, and more. It’s <strong>$100&#x2F;month.</strong> It should be more.</p>
<h3 id="Mortgage-Body-Corporate-Insurance"><a href="#Mortgage-Body-Corporate-Insurance" class="headerlink" title="Mortgage + Body Corporate + Insurance"></a>Mortgage + Body Corporate + Insurance</h3><p>It’s by far my largest expense each month <strong>(~$2000)</strong>, but it’s better than renting, and <em>way better</em> than flatting.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s definitely things I’ve forgotten in the list (e.g domain names, credit card fees), but I think these are all the interesting items I pay for. Next time, I’ll go through all the things I don’t pay for.</p>
